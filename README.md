# amdgpu-sim

`amdgpu-sim` is a source-backed, host-side AMDGPU simulation stack.  Its
long-term purpose is to let HIP, OpenCL, Triton, PyTorch, and vLLM workloads
submit real AMDGPU code objects to gem5 without a guest kernel, `/dev/kfd`,
`/dev/dri`, or the production AMD UMD/KMD binaries.

The root is a control-plane and transaction-coordinator repository. The six
pinned upstream source lanes and the project-authored `self-amdgpu-runtime`
lane are standard Git submodules under `projects/`. Each child retains
independent history and an immutable annotated baseline tag, while the root
gitlink records its exact current head, tests, checkpoints, and lessons.
`SOURCE_LOCK.json` owns upstream provenance; `PROJECT_LANES.json` owns our
project baselines; accepted checkpoints own descendant work heads. Model
weights, virtual environments, and build
outputs are downloaded or built by scripts into ignored paths and are never
stored in Git.

The first hard acceptance target is the official text-only
`Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B` checkpoint, served by vLLM with tensor parallelism across
two independent gem5 instances, producing at least one greedy token with the
same token ID as the reference and no CPU arithmetic fallback.  The protocol
is N-rank from the beginning so TP=4/8 can follow without a pair-specific
rewrite.

Read [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for the complete staged plan and [GOAL.md](GOAL.md) for
the immutable acceptance anchor.  A blank-context handoff starts with:

继续执行 amdgpu-sim 计划。从 checkpoint 指定的下一条唯一动作继续：先读取
PLAN.md、GOAL.md、SOURCE_LOCK.json、state/current.json、最新 checkpoint 和
bitlesson，运行 scripts/resume.sh --verify；不要重做已通过的工作。
```

`CP-0007` is the accepted bridge-private signal/event boundary. The standalone
runtime and gem5 preserve the CP-0004 byte-exact handshake, CP-0005 bounded
queue control, CP-0006 sparse simulated-memory transfer, and N=1/2/3/4/8
isolation gates while adding signed 64-bit signal create/load/store/destroy,
generation-safe one-shot waits, event-queue completion, bounded outbound
accounting, shared request correlation, and retry/poison semantics. The signal
records remain host transport primitives: they do not expose GPU-visible signal
memory or claim packet submission, code-object loading, or GPU execution. The
next action is `P1-DISPATCH-01`: bind functional allocations to gem5 GPU VA and
execute one traced trivial gfx950 AQL dispatch, then verify bytes with the CP7
signal wait and D2H path. The frozen `SOURCE_LOCK.json` and registered project
baseline remain immutable.
