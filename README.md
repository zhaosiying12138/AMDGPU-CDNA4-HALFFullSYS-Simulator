# amdgpu-sim

`amdgpu-sim` is a source-backed, host-side AMDGPU simulation stack.  Its
long-term purpose is to let HIP, OpenCL, Triton, PyTorch, and vLLM workloads
submit real AMDGPU code objects to gem5 without a guest kernel, `/dev/kfd`,
`/dev/dri`, or the production AMD UMD/KMD binaries.

The project is intentionally bootstrapped as a control-plane repository.  The
large upstream source lanes are kept as independent Git repositories under
`projects/`; the root records exact upstream commits, patch ancestry, tests,
checkpoints, and lessons.  Model weights, virtual environments, and build
outputs are downloaded or built by scripts into ignored paths and are never
stored in Git.

The first hard acceptance target is the official text-only
`Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B` checkpoint, served by vLLM with tensor parallelism across
two independent gem5 instances, producing at least one greedy token with the
same token ID as the reference and no CPU arithmetic fallback.  The protocol
is N-rank from the beginning so TP=4/8 can follow without a pair-specific
rewrite.

Read [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for the complete staged plan and [GOAL.md](GOAL.md) for
the immutable acceptance anchor.  A blank-context handoff starts with:

```text
继续执行 amdgpu-sim 计划。从 checkpoint 指定的下一条唯一动作继续：先读取
PLAN.md、GOAL.md、SOURCE_LOCK.json、state/current.json、最新 checkpoint 和
bitlesson，运行 scripts/resume.sh --verify；不要重做已通过的工作。
```

The current bootstrap deliberately stops before cloning upstream projects.
